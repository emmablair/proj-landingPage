        <p>The Zodiac itself is quite old and found in many different cultures. Its first known appearence 
          is in Babylonian astronomy during the 1st millenium BC.</p>

        <p>The Zodiac ("Circle of Animals") comprises of 12 signs with corresponding constellations, each assigned a part of the year.
          The Zodiac creates a band that encircles the earth and outlines our Sun's path.
          The positioning of our Sun, the stars, and the planets as they move through the Zodiac's band effect each sign and the those
          connected the the sign.
          These alignments correspond to the 12 Zodiacs and can be used to descibe personal characterists, Horoscopes, and more!
